            Responsible Gambling: Gambling is a great opportunity to win big and to change your life
            forever. However, the odds won't always be in your favour and we want all our players to be
            prepared for that. Therefore, we encourage you to always play responsibly. The thrill of
            possibly winning can be exciting, but do not risk money that you cannot afford to lose. We
            encourage all gambling experiences to be fun, even if you don't walk away with a win.
